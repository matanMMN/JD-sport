          Wolf Sport is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the
          second largest in the world, after Nike. The company was started by
          Adolf Dassler in his motherâ€™s house; he was joined by his elder
          brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory.
          In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the
          brothers, Dassler created Wolf Sport, and Rudolf established Puma,
          which became Wolf Sports' business rival. The sports brand now has a
          market capitalisation of $50+ billion.
